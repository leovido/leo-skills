## 🔴 STRICT RULES (Must Follow)

### Package Management
- **MUST use [PACKAGE_MANAGER]** (version [VERSION]) - never use [ALTERNATIVES]
- **MUST use [LINTER]** for both linting and formatting (not [ALTERNATIVES])
- **MUST use [TEST_FRAMEWORK]** as the testing framework
- **MUST use [LANGUAGE]** with strict mode enabled
- **MUST use [FRAMEWORK]** [VERSION] for all [PROJECT_TYPE] projects

### Code Quality
- **MUST avoid [ANTI_PATTERN]** - use proper [ALTERNATIVE] when necessary
- **MUST format code with [TOOL]** before committing
- **MUST run linting checks** before committing

### [FRAMEWORK] Best Practices
- **MUST follow [FRAMEWORK]'s "[GUIDANCE_NAME]"** guidance
- **MUST NOT use [PATTERN] for [USE_CASE]** - [ALTERNATIVE_APPROACH]
- **MUST always include [REQUIREMENT]** in [CONTEXT]

### Git Workflow
- **MUST use [COMMIT_FORMAT] format**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
  - Types: `[TYPE1]`, `[TYPE2]`, `[TYPE3]`, etc.
- **MUST configure pre-commit hooks** to run: [HOOK1], [HOOK2], [HOOK3]
- **MUST configure pre-push hooks** to run: [HOOK1], [HOOK2]

### CI/CD
- **MUST include these PR checks**: [CHECK1], [CHECK2], [CHECK3], [CHECK4]
- **MUST ensure all CI checks pass** before merging PRs

### Environment Variables
- **MUST use [TOOL]** for environment variable management
- **MUST NEVER commit `[FILE_PATTERN]` files** to version control
- **MUST include `[EXAMPLE_FILE]`** file with required variables (no secrets)
- **MUST validate required environment variables** at application startup

### Testing
- **MUST use [TEST_FRAMEWORK]** for all projects

---

## 🟡 GUIDELINES (Preferred, but Flexible)

### Code Quality
- **PREFER** [CONFIGURATION] configuration
- **PREFER** organizing code using [DESIGN_PATTERN] principles ([DESCRIPTION])
- **PREFER** [TEST_ORGANIZATION_PATTERN]

### Git Workflow
- **PREFER** using [TOOL] for managing git hooks ([NOTE])

### Testing
- **PREFER** using [LIBRARY] for component testing
- **PREFER** following the [PATTERN] pattern in tests

## Notes

- Strict rules are non-negotiable and must be followed in all cases
- Guidelines are preferred approaches but can be adapted based on project needs
- When in doubt, refer to the detailed SKILL documentation in `skills/` directory
- These rules should be reviewed and updated regularly as best practices evolve
