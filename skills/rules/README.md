# Cursor Rules

This folder contains Cursor rules organized by topic. Cursor automatically reads all `.md` files in the `rules/` folder.

## Rule Files

- **skillport.md** - Skillport skills auto-loading configuration
- **orchestration.md** - Multi-agent orchestration rules and workflows
- **standards.md** - Development standards and best practices

## Usage

These rules are automatically loaded by Cursor when present in the `rules/` folder. No additional configuration is needed.

## Adding New Rules

Create a new `.md` file in this folder with your rules. Cursor will automatically include it.

## Organization

Rules are split by topic for better maintainability:
- Keep related rules together
- Use descriptive file names
- Reference other rule files when needed
